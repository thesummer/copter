You may be able to write the most eloquent code in the history of embedded systems but without a way to run it on the hardware it will be worthless. In this installment of the tutorial series we will:

  -Look at some of the available AVR programmer options
  -Place the microcontroller on a breadboard and connect it to a power supply and a programmer.
  -Use programming software to send some example code to the microcontroller
