The master (raspberryPi) controls the duty cycles of all 4 channels of the slave via the I2C-interface.
Change the name of I2CPORT and the PWM_SLAVE_ADDRESS accordingly in main.c.
In order to compile the header-files of the ncurses-library are needed.
Then compile with
gcc main.c -o master -lncurses

The slave initializes 4 pwm channels and reads the duty cycle from the rx-buffer of the I2C interface. The I2C-driver library from Martin Junghans is used for I2C implementation.
Compile with:
make
To program the microcontroller use:
make program (make sure to adapt your controller and your programmer in the makefile first)
